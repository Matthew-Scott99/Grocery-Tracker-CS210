# Grocery Tracker - CS210 Project

This project was built for my CS210 class. The goal was to make a simple grocery tracking program in C++ that reads a list of items from a file and keeps track of how many times each item shows up.

## What the program does
It reads from a grocery data file and stores each item into a map. Then it gives the user a menu to search for specific items, see all the item counts, print a histogram using stars, or just exit the program. It also writes everything to a backup file.

## What I did
I wrote the program using a class called GroceryTracker. I made sure everything was organized and each function had a specific job. I handled the file input and output, set up the map to store the data, and added input checking to keep things from breaking.

## What I learned
I got more comfortable working with C++ maps, classes, file I/O, and basic user input. The class structure helped keep things neat. Debugging some of the input stuff took time, but I got it all working.

## How it could be better
You could probably break the code into even more reusable parts or add more detailed error messages. But for this project, it works how itâ€™s supposed to and does what was asked.
